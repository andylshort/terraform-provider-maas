## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the package repository.
*Note*: the Name field for the Ubuntu Archive and Ubuntu Ports repos are `main_archive` and `ports_archive` respectively. As they are default resources, the MAAS UI shows a different name to their internal database name entry.
- `url` (String) The URL of the package repository.

### Optional

- `arches` (Set of String) The list of supported architectures.
- `components` (Set of String) The list of components to enable. Only applicable to custom repositories.
- `disable_sources` (Boolean) Disable deb-src lines.
- `disabled_components` (Set of String) The list of components to disable. Only applicable to the default Ubuntu repositories.
- `disabled_pockets` (Set of String) The list of pockets to disable. This only applies to Ubuntu repositories; custom or not.
- `distributions` (Set of String) Which package distributions to include.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether or not the repository is enabled.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The authentication key to use with the repository.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# A package repository can be imported using the Repo ID, Name, or URL.
$ terraform import maas_package_repository.test "main_archive"

# (See the `Name` note above as to why `Ubuntu archive` is imported with `main_archive`)
```

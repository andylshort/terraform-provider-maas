# maas_ssh_keys (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage one or many SSH keys in MAAS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage a single key in MAAS
resource "maas_ssh_keys" "single_key" {
  keys = [
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIP55TGiiUJ8ShRvhvg1tq2Rrhn4fjbzy7hYAopT6QVYE"
  ]
}

# Import all keys from a Launchpad user and manage them together
resource "maas_ssh_keys" "from_launchpad" {
  keysource = "lp:mylaunchpadid"
}

# Import all keys from a GitHub user and manage them together
resource "maas_ssh_keys" "from_github" {
  keysource = "gh:mygithubusername"
}

# Manage multiple keys in MAAS together
resource "maas_ssh_keys" "multiple_keys" {
  keys = [
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIP55TGiiUJ8ShRvhvg1tq2Rrhn4fjbzy7hYAopT6QVYE",
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINGSy3uNIEXvrmSc96uqqbLt1iNHK2HOC8YtFmPADZye",

## Schema

### Optional

- `keys` (Set of String) Valid SSH public keys. If specified, these keys will be uploaded to MAAS. Otherwise this field will be computed.
- `keysource` (String) The source of the SSH key(s). Can be used to 'import' a requesting user's SSH keys from a source for a specific user into MAAS, specified in the format source:user. Valid sources include 'lp' for Launchpad and 'gh' for GitHub. E.g. 'lp:my_launchpad_username'. **Note** all keys from the source will be imported into MAAS, and all keys will be managed by this resource. Keysources are not supported for import, so the expected keys must be specified using the `keys` field.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# An existing SSH key can be imported using its id. e.g.
$ terraform import maas_ssh_keys.single_key 1

# Multiple SSH keys can be imported and managed together as a single resource by using "/". e.g.
$ terraform import maas_ssh_keys.multiple_keys 1/2/3
```
